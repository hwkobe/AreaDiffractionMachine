\section{The Caking Algorithm}

A caked plot is similar to a radial ($r$ vs. $\theta$) plot 
of the area diffraction data as it would appear if it were
captured on an untilted detector. A radial plot will turn
circles of constant $r$ into straight lines.
Caking is important because diffraction peaks will 
also become straight lines. A caked plot is actually a 
plot of $Q$ vs. $\chi$. 
Although the relationship is not linear, $Q$ increase as $r$ 
increases and therefore $Q$ is similar to $r$.
$\chi$ corresponds to the angle radially around the x-ray
beam. So a cake is analogous to a radial 
plot.

Cakes are calculated as follows.
$Q$ and $\chi$ space is first binned. Since each bin has 
some particular $Q$ and $\chi$ value\footnote{Technically,
each bin has a $Q$ and $\chi$ range. The middle of the bin 
is taken to be the particular $Q$ and $\chi$ value.} 
the corresponding $(x''',y''')$ pair can be calculate for each
bin using equation~\ref{invertx} and \ref{inverty}. The
intensity value at the pixel coordinate $(x''',y''')$
is put into the bin.
$(x''',y''')$ is generally between a pixel coordinate so
a bilinear interpolation of the intensity is used to
get a best estimate.

Pixel masks can be used to ignore parts of the caked data.
Whenever the program finds an intensity value
that should be masked (either because it is too 
large, too small, or in a polygon mask), it fills
that part of the caked array with a particular 
negative value. When the caked data is displayed,
these negative values are shown a with special color.

Finally, in order to insure there is not an ambiguity between
negative intensity values and these special negative values, the 
program will always set the intensity of all bins whose intensity is 
less then zero to equal zero. If the diffraction data contains pixels 
with negative values, this could cause problems. But this is rarely
the case. This clipping of negative values was added in version 2
of the program.

The program can perform a polarization correction of
the caked data. The polarization 
correction is
\begin{align}
    I&=Im/PF \\ 
    PF&=P(1 - (\sin(2\theta)\sin(\chi-90))^2) + 
    (1 - P)(1 - (\sin(2\theta)\cos(\chi-90))^2)
\end{align}
with $Im$ the measured intensity. The $2\theta$ and $\chi$
values are for to the particular value that is being 
corrected. All pixels have their 
intensity corrected by this formula before they
are binned.

\section{Caking With the Program}

Caking is done with the \gui{Caking} tab shown in figure~\ref{caking_tab}
The program can only cake data after diffraction data and calibration
parameters have been loaded into the program.
In order to cake, this program needs to know the range
in $Q$ and $\chi$ space that should be caked. 
This can be specified with the \gui{Q Lower?}, \gui{Q Upper?}
\gui{Chi Lower?}, and \gui{Chi Upper?} inputs.
The program also needs to know how many $Q$ and $\chi$ bins to 
create when caking. This can be set
with the \gui{Number of Q?} and \gui{Number of Chi?} inputs.
The \gui{Do Cake} button can then be used to cake the data. 

\begin{SCfigure}[1][bthp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.75]{figures/caking_tab.eps}
    \caption{Caking is done with the \gui{Caking} tab.} 
    \label{caking_tab}
\end{SCfigure}

\begin{SCfigure}[1][bthp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.75]{figures/cake_data_window.eps}
    \caption{The caked data window will open after the
    data is caked.} 
    \label{cake_data_window}
\end{SCfigure}

After the cake finishes, the program will open a caked data
window that displays the cake interactively.
The caked data window acts just like the diffraction
data window so everything in Chapter~\ref{viewing_data} 
carries over. The only difference is that whenever
the caked data is zoomed into, the program will take
the selected zoom range and put it into the inputs on
the cake tab and then recake the image. The caked 
can be taken to the previous zoom range with the 
\gui{Last Cake} button 

\section{AutoCake}

\gui{AutoCake} is a button on the \gui{Cake} tab that 
will guess a good range of $Q$ and $\chi$ 
values, put them into the inputs, and then push the 
\gui{Do Cake} button automatically. It can be used to
create a cake without much work. \gui{AutoCake} will pick a range
that puts the entire diffraction image into the cake. It will pick
a bin sizes so that each displayed pixel correspond to one bin. 
This will ensure that the cake looks as sharp as the computer 
can display it.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Displaying $Q$ and $\Delta Q$ Lines}
    {Displaying Q and delta Q Lines}}
    \label{cakeQlinesandpeaks}

If a $Q$ list has been loaded into the program, 
constant $Q$ lines or $\Delta Q$ lines can be 
displayed on top of the cake. 
Constant $Q$ lines on the diffraction image are 
vertical lines on the caked plot. 
The program will display constant $Q$ lines or 
$\Delta Q$ lines on the caked plot whenever they 
should be displayed on the diffraction image. See 
section~\ref{displayconstQlines} and 
section~\ref{displayconstdQlines} for a discussion of 
displaying constant $Q$ lines on diffraction data.
Figure~\ref{constant_q_lines_on_cake_image} shows constant
$Q$ lines displayed on a caked plot and 
figure~\ref{constant_dq_lines_on_cake_image} shows constant
$\Delta Q$ lines displayed on a caked plot.

\end{figure}

\section{Displaying Peaks}\label{displaying_peaks_cake}

Any peaks that the program finds when 
calibrating can be displayed on top of the caked
data as crosses. Peaks will be displayed on the caked plot whenever 
they are displayed on the diffraction image. 
Figure~\ref{peaks_on_cake_image} 
shows peaks displayed on a caked plot.  Being able to display 
$Q$ lines and peaks on caked data can be very useful for 
checking if the calibration was done properly. 
Figure~\ref{calibration_cake} illustrates this principle.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \subfloat[A bad calibration]{

    \caption{Displaying peaks and constant $Q$ lines on top of a 
    cake of a calibration standard can be used to tell if the data was properly 
    calibrated. If the calibration is bad, the diffraction peaks will have 
    a systematic distortion. If the calibration is good, all the peaks will 
    cluster very close to their particular $Q$ value and there will be no 
    systematic distortion.}

\end{figure}

\section{Polarization Correction}

The \gui{Do Polarization Correction?} check box
can be used to apply a polarization correction to the cake
and the polarization value can be set with the \gui{P?} input.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Working in $2\theta$}{Working in 2theta}}

Caked plots can have $2\theta$ instead of $Q$ as one
of the axes. The program can change 
to $2\theta$ mode by going into the file menu and selecting 
the \gui{Work in 2theta} option. When this is selected,
all the names in the program will change from $Q$ to $2\theta$. 
The program will have \gui{$2\theta$ Lower}, \gui{$2\theta$ Upper}, 
and \gui{Number of $2\theta$} as inputs. The allowed range will
then be in $2\theta$ and the program will display the cake image with
$2\theta$ as an axis. The corresponding \gui{Work in Q} option 
can be used to return the program to caking in $Q$.
This feature was introduced in version 2.0.0.

\section{Saving Cake Data}

Caked data can be saved as a plain text 
using the \gui{Save Data} button. The format for cake files is 
a long comment string followed by the data in rows of numbers:
\begin{lstlisting}
# Cake of: N:/data/LaB6_14_02_56.mar3450 
# Data Caked on Wed Mar 12 21:30:55 2008
# Calibration data used to make the cake:
#   x center:    1725.0000000 pixels
#   y center:    1725.0000000 pixels
#   distance:     125.2960000 mm
#   energy:     12735.3957721 eV
#   alpha:          0.0000000 degrees
#   beta:           0.0000000 degrees
#   rotation:       0.0000000 degrees
#   pixel length:     100.0000000 microns
#   pixel height:     100.0000000 microns
# A Polarization correction was applied
#   P = 0.500000
# A greater than mask was applied
#   Greater than mask = 1000.000000
# A Less Than Mask was applied
#   Less than mask = 10.000000
# Polygon mask(s) were applied
# Polygon(s) used in the analysis:
#   2400.10912343	1073.5706619
#   962.511627907	2282.88014311
#   2850.51520572	2572.86762075
#
#   1573.33631485	1215.47942755
#   1820.13416816	2893.70483005
#   2906.04472272	1573.33631485
# Cake range:
#   Q Lower = 0.000000
#   Q Upper = 6.726544
#   Number of Q = 560.000000
#   Q Step = 0.012012
#   chi Lower = -180.000000
#   chi Upper = 180.000000
#   Number of Chi = 560.000000
#   chi Step = 0.642857
# Note: pixels outside the diffraction image are saved as -1
#   Pixels greater than the greater than mask are saved as -2
#   Pixels less than the less than mask are saved as -3
#   Pixels inside of a polygon masks are saved as -4
# chi increased down. Q increases to the right
\end{lstlisting}
the header describes what state the program was in when the 
cake was done. It first lists the name of the diffraction 
file(s) that were caked. It then lists the calibration parameters, 
the polarization correction, the threshold masks, and the polygon masks 
used when caking. It then lists the pixel 
coordinates of any polygons used.  It then lists 
the range of the cake and the number of bins that were used.
The program tries to be smart about the comment string. So if
no masks were used, the comment string would instead contains 
\begin{lstlisting}
# No greater than mask was applied
# No less than mask was applied
# No polygon masks were applied
\end{lstlisting}
If the program is working in $2\theta$, the comment string would
instead say 
\begin{lstlisting}
#   2theta Lower = 0.000000
#   2theta Upper = 62.814525
#   number of 2theta = 560.000000
#   2theta Step = 0.112169
\end{lstlisting}

Then comes the data. Each line is of constant 
$\chi$ and contains many numbers separated by
spaces. Each column is of constant $Q$. $\chi$ increases down and 
$Q$ increases to the right. The program sets certain bins in 
the data to special values. Bins outside the diffraction
image are saved as -1. Bins masked because they are too 
large are saved as -2. Bins masked because they are too 
small are saved as -3. Bins inside a pixel mask are saved 
as -4. This is also noted in the comment string. 

\section{Saving Cake Images}

Caked data can be saved as one of many popular image formats.
The program can save caked images as \gui{jpg}, \gui{gif}, \gui{eps}, 
\gui{pdf}, \gui{bmp}, \gui{png}, or \gui{tiff}.  A caked image
will be saved with whatever threshold masks, polygon masks, $Q$ lines, 
$\Delta Q$ lines, and peaks were displayed over the caked data.
