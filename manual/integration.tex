\section{The Integration Algorithm}\label{integration_algorithm}

An intensity integration is a plot of average intensity as 
a function either $Q$, $2\theta$, or $\chi$. The calibration 
values for the diffraction data must be known before 
the integration is done. A range and bin size for the
integration must be give. For example, a $Q-I$ integration 
might have a range from 2 to 5 with 100 bins. 

The algorithm for performing an intensity integration
is as follows: loop over every pixel in the image. 
Add its intensity to a bin if its $Q$, $2\theta$, 
or $\chi$ value falls within the bin's range.
Remember that the calibration parameters are used to 
calculate these from the pixel coordinates.
After binning all the pixels, the bins are then averaged.

This program can constrain the integration range. 
This can be used, for example, to integrate
in $Q$ only those pixels with some particular 
$\chi$ range or to integrate
in $\chi$ for only a particular
$Q$ range. This could be used, for example, to
perform a $\chi$ integration of only one
diffraction peak. The program applies the constraint
by only binning pixels allowed by the constraint.

The program can perform a polarization 
correction by correcting all pixel before they
are binned by
\begin{align}
    I&=Im/PF \\ 
    PF&=P(1 - (\sin(2\theta)\sin(\chi-90))^2) + 
    (1 - P)(1 - (\sin(2\theta)\cos(\chi-90))^2)
\end{align}
with $Im$ the measured intensity.  The $2\theta$ 
and $\chi$ values correspond to the particular 
value that is being corrected.

Finally, if no pixels were put into a particular
intensity bin, the bin's intensity is set to -1 as
a flag that the bin doesn't contain any data.
To avoid ambiguity, the program will
set all bins with negative intensities to have
an intensity of zero. If the diffraction data contains 
pixels with negative values, this could cause problems. 
But this is rarely the case. This clipping of negative 
values was added in version 2 of the program.


\section{Integrating with the Program}

The program requires one or more diffraction images and
calibration parameters to be loaded into the program
before an intensity integration is done.
Figure~\ref{integration_tab} shows the
\gui{Integrate} tab where integration is done.
There are two sets of inputs on the tab. 
The inputs on the left are titled \gui{Q-I Integration}
and are used for performing $Q$ integration.
The integration range in $Q$ and the number of $Q$ bins
can be specified with the \gui{Q Lower?}, \gui{Q Upper?},
and \gui{Number of Q?} inputs. The \gui{Integrate} button
on the left does the $Q$ integration.

\begin{SCfigure}[1][bthp]

    \includegraphics[scale=.75]{figures/integration_tab.eps}
    \caption{The integration tab is used for intensity
    integration.}
    \label{integration_tab}
\end{SCfigure}

The inputs on the right are titled \gui{Chi-I Integration}
and can be used for performing a $\chi$ integration.

The integration range in $\chi$ and the number of $\chi$ bins
can be specified with the \gui{Chi Lower?}, \gui{Chi Upper?},
and \gui{Number of Chi?} inputs. 
The \gui{Integrate} button on the right does the $\chi$ integration.

\section{The Integration Window}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subfloat[A $Q-I$ integration.]{
    \label{integration_window_q}
    \includegraphics[scale=.75]{figures/integration_window_q.eps}\hspace{1em}}
    \subfloat[A $\chi-I$ integration.]{
    \label{integration_window_chi}
    \includegraphics[scale=.75]{figures/integration_window_chi.eps}}
    \caption{The integration window 
    opens after an intensity integration.} 
    \label{integration_window_both}
\end{figure}

A line plot
of the integrated data will be displayed in a new window
after the program finishes integrating. 
Figure~\ref{integration_window_q} shows 
the integration window displaying $Q-I$ integrated data
and figure~\ref{integration_window_chi} shows the
window displaying $\chi-I$ integrated data.
You can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\em Zoom into the data} -- left click on the plot and 
    hold down on the mouse. The program will create a resizing 
    rectangle that follows the mouse. When the mouse is 
    released, the program will zoom into the selected range.
    \item {\em Zoom out of the data} -- right
    click on the plot.
    \item {\em Resize the window} -- click on the bottom right 
    corner of the window and drag. The window will resize just 
    like any other window and the plot will become larger or 
    smaller.  
    \item {\em Read coordinates for a selected point} --
    when mousing over the plot, the selected $Q$, $\chi$
    or $2\theta$ and intensity value will be displayed at
    the bottom of the window.
    \item {\em Log Scaling} -- the \gui{Log Scale?} check box
    will toggle whether to display the intensity axis as
    a log scale.
\end{itemize}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Working in $2\theta$}{Working in 2theta}}

This program can integrate in $2\theta$ instead of $Q$. 
The \gui{Work in 2theta} option in the menu bar will
make the label on the left to say 
\gui{$2\theta$-I Integration}. The inputs will 
change to \gui{$2\theta$ Lower}, \gui{$2\theta$ Upper}, 
and \gui{Number of $2\theta$}. The 
\gui{Integrate} button will then perform an integrate 
in $2\theta$. The diffraction window will display
average intensity as a function of $2\theta$.
If there are any values in the \gui{Q Lower} or
\gui{Q Upper} inputs, they will be convert from $Q$ to $2\theta$
values when the program switches. The \gui{Work in Q} option
in the menu bar can be used to change the program 
back to working with $Q$ and any $2\theta$ values will
be converted back.

\section{AutoIntegrate}

The \gui{AutoIntegrate} button 
on the left will guess a nice range of $Q$ 
(or $2\theta$) and then do the $Q$ (or
$2\theta$) integration.
It will always make the lower $Q$ (or $2\theta$)
value 0 and the upper value large enough
to include all the data.
It will set the number of $Q$ (or $2\theta$) to
200. The \gui{AutoIntegrate} button on the right 
will guess a nice range of $\chi$ and 
do the $\chi$ integration. It will always 
set \gui{Chi Lower} to -180, \gui{Chi Upper} to
180, and \gui{Number of Chi} to 200.

\section{Constraining the Inputs}

As was described in 
section~\ref{integration_algorithm}, a $Q$ or $2\theta$ 
integration can be done only of values in a 
particular $\chi$ range. A $\chi$ integration 
can only be done only of a particular $Q$ or $2\theta$ 
range. 
The integration can be constrained with the 
\gui{Constrain With Range On Right?} and 
\gui{Constrain With Range On Left?} check boxes.
When \gui{Constrain With Range On Right?} is
selected,
the $Q$ or $2\theta$ integration 
will be constrained in $\chi$ by the chi
range specified by \gui{Chi Lower} and 
\gui{Chi Upper}. When 
\gui{Constrain With Range On Left?} is selected, 
the $\chi$ integration will be constrained by
either the $Q$ range specified by \gui{Q Lower?}
and \gui{Q Upper?} or the $2\theta$ range specified by 
\gui{$2\theta$ Lower?} and \gui{$2\theta$ Upper?}.

\section{Masking}

The program allows for masking of certain
pixels while integrating. Masking is done whenever the
\gui{Do Greater Than Mask?}, \gui{Do Less Than Mask?},
or \gui{Do Polygon Mask?} check boxes are selected.
Whenever the program finds an intensity value
that should should be masked (either because it 
is too large, too small, or in a polygon mask), the
program will ignore the pixel and not bin it.
Refer to Chapter \ref{pixel_masking} for a discussion
of masking.

\section{Saving Integrated Data}

The intensity integrated data can be saved to a file
using the \gui{Save Data} button. 
A typical integration file looks like:

The header describes the state of the program 
when the integration was performed.
The fist line describes what type of integration was
performed. If a $\chi-I$ integration was 
performed, the header file would say
\macroline{\# Chi vs I Intensity Integration}.
The header then contains the name(s) of the diffraction
files that were integrated, the
calibration parameters that were used when integrating,
any polarization correction that was used, and any threshold 
It describes any constrains 
on the integration and the integration range. Following the header 
is the line
\macroline{\# Q Avg Intensity} (or \macroline{\# Chi Avg Intensity}
or \macroline{\# 2theta	Avg Intensity}) followed by 
the data. Each line contains two numbers.
The first number is the middle $Q$ (or $\chi$ or $2\theta$ value) 
in the bin and the second number is the average intensity.
