= The Area Diffraction Machine = 

The Area Diffraction Machine analyzes two dimensional powder diffraction data. It is free open source software. It is still in development so check back frequently for updates.

= What Does it Do? =

== It displays diffraction data interactively ==

Load in mar2300, mar3450, marCCD, tiff, and now edf diffraction data.

Change the intensity scale or color map.

== Image Calibration ==
 
Use the calibration tab.

http://areadiffractionmachine.googlecode.com/files/calibration-tab.jpg

The program can calibrate standard diffraction images with inputted Q values. This calibration can be done with only the Q values and an initial guess of the calibration values. Calibration does not require manually clicking on the screen to find diffraction peaks!

== Masking ==

This program can apply both a greater then or less than threshold mask to the diffraction data. It can add polygon masks to different areas of the diffraction data.

== Perform a Q-χ Cake the data ==

== Perform an Intensity Integration== 

Perform a Q-I integration, a 2θ-I integration, and a χ-I integration.

== Automate the program with Macros ==

Fully automate the program using a rich macro language.

= Get It =

There are Mac and Windows executable of the program that can be easily installed. You can also run the program from source on Linux.

= Questions? =

There is a Discussion Group for the program at [http://groups.google.com/group/area-diffraction-machine here]. If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, feel free to post them to the group by emailing [mailto:area-diffraction-machine@googlegroups.com area-diffraction-machine@googlegroups.com]. If you have any issues with the program, please submit them to the issue tracker.
