# The Area Diffraction Machine

The Area Diffraction Machine analyzes two dimensional powder diffraction data. It is free open source software.

# Get It 

Download Mac and Windows executables and documentation [here](https://github.com/joshualande/AreaDiffractionMachine/tree/master/Downloads).
You can also run the program [from source on Linux](https://github.com/joshualande/AreaDiffractionMachine/wiki/BuildOnLinux:-How-to-get-the-program-running-on-Debian-Ubuntu).

# What Does it Do?

## It displays diffraction data interactively

Load in mar2300, mar3450, marCCD, tiff, and now edf diffraction data.

Change the intensity scale or color map.

## Image Calibration
 
Use the calibration tab.

![calibration-tab](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/AreaDiffractionMachine/master/media_files/calibration-tab.jpg)

The program can calibrate standard diffraction images with inputted Q values. This calibration can be done with only the Q values and an initial guess of the calibration values. Calibration does not require manually clicking on the screen to find diffraction peaks!

## Masking

![masking-tab](https://raw.github.com/joshualande/AreaDiffractionMachine/master/media_files/masking-tab.jpg)

This program can apply both a greater then or less than threshold mask to the diffraction data. It can add polygon masks to different areas of the diffraction data.

## Perform a Q-χ Cake the data

## Perform an Intensity Integration 

Perform a Q-I integration, a 2θ-I integration, and a χ-I integration.
