# NOTE about Google Code

The Area Diffraction Machine is also hosten on Google Code at areadiffractionmachine.googlecode.com. The source code is hosted here. The executables, documentation, wiki, and issue tracker are hosted there.

# The Area Diffraction Machine

The Area Diffraction Machine analyzes two dimensional powder diffraction data. It is free open source software. It is still in development so check back frequently for updates.

# What Does it Do?

## It displays diffraction data interactively

Load in mar2300, mar3450, marCCD, tiff, and now edf diffraction data.

Change the intensity scale or color map.

## Image Calibration
 
Use the calibration tab.

![calibration-tab](http://areadiffractionmachine.googlecode.com/files/calibration-tab.jpg)

The program can calibrate standard diffraction images with inputted Q values. This calibration can be done with only the Q values and an initial guess of the calibration values. Calibration does not require manually clicking on the screen to find diffraction peaks!

## Masking

![masking-tab](http://areadiffractionmachine.googlecode.com/files/masking-tab.jpg)

This program can apply both a greater then or less than threshold mask to the diffraction data. It can add polygon masks to different areas of the diffraction data.

## Perform an Intensity Integration 

Perform a Q-I integration, a 2θ-I integration, and a χ-I integration.

## Automate the program with Macros

Fully automate the program using a rich macro language.
