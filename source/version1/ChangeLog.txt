Change Log for version 1 of the Area Diffraction Machine

-------

Changes in progress
    
    - Fix a bug where when displaying the residual function,
      the program would, even after fitting say something
      like "Before fitting, the calculated residual is 
      6.532131e-06". Now it says "After fitting" as it should.
    - Allow for caking in 2theta.
    - Ignores any peaks found inside of polygon masks. Also,
      these peaks are no longer displayed on top of the
      diffraction and cake displays when they are on 
      top of a polygon mask.

Changes for version 1.0.3 - (The SVN revision for it is r114)

    -   Improving support of marCCD data (.mccd).
    -   Introducing the new macro commands
        FOLDERPATH and FOLDERNAME.

Changes for version 1.0.2 - (The SVN revision for it is r108)

    -   Fixed a bug in the way ESRF Data is read on 
        Windows. 
    -   Added code for saving loaded image as ESRF Data.

Changes for version 1.0.1 - (The SVN revision for it is r106)
    
    -   Added support for the ESRF Data Format (.edf). 

Changes for version 1.0.0 - (The SVN revision for it is r100)

    -   Adding code so that from within a macro the program can 
        read in multiple files and add them together. This feature
        can also be incorporated into a loop. See the manual
        for documentation of this feature.
