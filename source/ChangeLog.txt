Change log for Version 2 (version 2 has all the version 1 changes in it):

Changes in the Betas

    Major
    -   Adding support for Bruker data files.

    -   Migrated the over from using Abhik's formulas for the
        geometric transform to Josh's formulas derived in
        the software manual. See the manual for a discussion
        of these equations.
    -   Modified the caking and integrating algorithm so that
        they will truncate all
    -   Allow for caking in 2theta.
    -   Ignores any peaks found inside of polygon masks. Also,
        these peaks are no longer displayed on top of the
        diffraction and cake displays when they are on 
        top of a polygon mask.
    -   Improved the formatting of saved peak list files.
        They have a better structure (space separated instead
        of tab separated) and a more verbose header.
    -   New "Save Last Fit" button can be used to save all of the 
        information about the previous calibration to a text file.
    -   Minor tic marks for intensity integration's log Y axis.
    -   New "Preferences" menu opened form the "File" menu can be 
        used to specify the default folder to select files form.
    -   New "Set As Initialization" option can be used to save
        a recorded macro to be run each time the program opens.
        This can be used to set various check boxes, colors, and
        user inputs to nice default values.
    -   New Abort Button to stop a macro.
    -   Macros will now create folders if necessary in order to
        save files specified to go into folders that don't yet 
        exist.

    Minor 
    -   The size of the inputs in the GUI has been increased 
        to help view big numbers.
    -   Fix a bug where the integration window wouldn't resize
        properly and sometimes the labels and check box at
        the bottom of the window would disappear
    -   Changed the formatting of calibration parameters saved
        to a file. For brevity, the keywords R, pl, and ph are 
        used instead of rotation, pixellength, and pixelheight.
        Also, the precision of the output parameters has been
        increased and the tabs in the output file are replaced
        by spaces. The program can read in files which contain
        any of the keywords.
    -   Increased the precision of the numbers saved during 
        caking.
    -   Increased the precision of the numbers saved during
        intensity integration. Also, the intensity data is 
        now saved with spaces separating the numbers instead
        of tabs.
    -   Changed the default extension of diffraction data
        that is loaded in from mar3450 to "All Files" so that
    -   Removed the Dark Current display from the "Calibration"
        tab since it wasn't doing anything.

Change Log for version 1 of the Area Diffraction Machine

Changes for upcoming version

    -   Fixed a minor bug where an error would be raised when you
        tried to finish drawing adding a polygon before adding any
        nodes to it.
    
    Minor

    -   Fix a very minor bug in the intensity integration where
        the value of the bin would be set to -1 (the value when
        no pixels were in the bin) if only one pixel was in the 
        bin.

Changes for version 1.0.4 - (The SVN revision for it is r139)
    -   Fixed Minor bug fix in the macro feature
    -   Fix a bug where when displaying the residual function,
        the program would, even after fitting say something
        like "Before fitting, the calculated residual is 
        6.532131e-06". Now it says "After fitting" as it should.

Changes for version 1.0.3 - (The SVN revision for it is r114)

    -   Improving support of marCCD data (.mccd).
    -   Introducing the new macro commands
        FOLDERPATH and FOLDERNAME.

Changes for version 1.0.2 - (The SVN revision for it is r108)

    -   Fixed a bug in the way ESRF Data is read on 
        Windows. 
    -   Added code for saving loaded image as ESRF Data.

Changes for version 1.0.1 - (The SVN revision for it is r106)
    
    -   Added support for the ESRF Data Format (.edf). 

Changes for version 1.0.0 - (The SVN revision for it is r100)

    -   Adding code so that from within a macro the program can 
        read in multiple files and add them together. This feature
        can also be incorporated into a loop. See the manual
        for documentation of this feature.
