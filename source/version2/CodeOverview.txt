The Area Diffraction Machine is spread out across many different files
and many different objects. The Tkinter GUI is created and all of the
event handling is done by AreaDiffractionMachine.py. So this file
is really the meat of the program, controlling the operation of the
program.

Called by AreaDiffractionMachine:
* MacroMode.py

There is one large object called DiffractionData inside the file
DiffractionData.py which handles basically all the diffraction
analysis (often by calling other files). You can use it to load
in diffraction data, to get header data out of it, to save the 
diffraction image as a popular image format, perform diffraction
image calibration, create and save peak lists to a file, cake
diffraction data and save cakes

* Cake.py
* Fit.py
* MakeDiffractionImage.py
* Reading Diffraction Data:
